## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note on Load Time

**‚è≥ First-time loading may take a few seconds.**

TrendPulse's backend is currently hosted on Render's free tier, which may put the server to sleep after periods of inactivity. As a result, the first request (e.g., loading analytics or trending content) can take **5‚Äì10 seconds** while the server "wakes up." This is a known limitation of cold starts on free cloud services and **does not reflect the app‚Äôs actual performance under normal usage**.

> Subsequent requests will load much faster once the server is active.

We appreciate your patience and understanding while we continue building toward a fully optimized experience.

## üöß Project Story & Status

TrendPulse began as a rapidly developed MVP (Minimum Viable Product) on Replit to prove out a core concept. A significant part of this project then involved **migrating the application from its original monolithic architecture to a scalable, multi-service cloud environment.**

This process showcased critical, real-world engineering skills, including:
- **Re-architecting** the backend build process from `tsc` to `esbuild`.
- **Configuring a CI/CD pipeline** for a frontend on Netlify and a backend on Render.
- **Implementing and debugging** a robust CORS policy for secure cross-origin communication.
- **Systematically resolving** a full-stack range of production errors, from build failures to frontend rendering crashes.

This journey highlights not just fast prototyping, but also the engineering discipline required to transform a proof-of-concept into a stable, production-ready application.

### Future Goals
- **Full mobile compatibility and responsive design.**
- Persistent database integration to replace in-memory storage.
- User authentication and saved project history.
- Deeper, multi-platform analytics.
